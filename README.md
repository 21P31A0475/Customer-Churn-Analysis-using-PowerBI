Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by telecom companies, directly impacting revenue and long-term growth.
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify churn patterns, high-risk customers, and key drivers behind churn using interactive Power BI dashboards.
The goal is to transform raw customer data into actionable business insights that help organizations reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Business Problem
Telecom companies face:
1. Loss of customers to competitors
2. Decreasing customer lifetime value
3. Limited visibility into why customers leave
Without analytical insights, it is difficult to detect churn early and take preventive actions.

Project Objectives
1. Analyze customer churn patterns and trends
2. Identify key factors influencing churn (tenure, contract type, charges, services)
3. Detect high-risk customers using data-driven insights
4. Measure the business impact of churn
5. Support better retention strategies through interactive dashboards

Dataset Information
1. Source: Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
2. Records: 7,043 customers
3. Features: 21 attributes
4. Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

Key Attributes
1. Customer demographics
2. Tenure & contract details
3. Service subscriptions
4. Billing and payment information

Data Preparation & Transformation
Data cleaning and transformation were performed inside Microsoft Power BI using Power Query:
1. Removed missing and inconsistent values
2. Corrected data types
3. Created tenure groups for lifecycle analysis
4. Standardized categorical fields
5. Ensured data accuracy for analysis

Dashboard & Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
1. Overall churn rate overview
2. Churn by tenure group
3. Churn by contract type
4. Churn vs monthly charges
5. Service-based churn analysis
6. Interactive slicers for deep exploration

Key Insights
1. Customers with short tenure (0–12 months) churn the most
2. Month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn rates
3. Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn
4. Customers without add-on services (tech support, security) are more likely to leave

Business Recommendations
1. Encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts
2. Improve onboarding for new customers
3. Offer targeted discounts to high-risk customers
4. Bundle value-added services to increase engagement
5. Monitor churn-prone segments proactively

Tools & Technologies
1. Microsoft Power BI – Dashboard & visualization
2. Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation
3. DAX – Calculated measures & KPIs
4. Excel – Initial data review

Project Outcome
1. This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can:
2. Reveal hidden churn patterns
3. Support proactive decision-making
4. Improve customer retention
5. Protect business revenue
